# Kata-TollsAndVehicles üíº

## Description
In this project we find a website to manage tolls where we can see two lists of different tolls and vehicles as well as being able to enter each of them.

## Proyect guide
As soon as we enter we see a home page where we can choose if we want to see the list of vehicles or tolls, when we enter one of these we will see a list, if we enter an element of the list we will see the information of this one. In the case of the cars we will also see how many tolls it has passed through and in the case of the tolls we will see how many cars have passed through it.
